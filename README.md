# DesignPatterns.Builder
This is a demonstration from my DesignPattern series.

This app is building different related objects (Instruments) using Builder Pattern.

At the moment there is only one Abstract Builder /StringedInstrumentsBuilder/AbstractBuilder.cs,
but more can be added and called from within the "Director" class: "/InstrumentShop.cs".
